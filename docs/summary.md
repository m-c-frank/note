# summary

this tool serves one purpose:

write down your thoughts before you forget them

after installing [note](https://github.com/m-c-frank/note/docs/instructions.md)

you can just write anything you need to remember

or any interesting thought you would like to someday remember

just run `note` followed by whatever you want to write

example:
```bash
note i need to make sure to write the instructions for note. i also need to make sure that i also turn this into a docker service so i can take notes from any application with an api call
```

thats it.

the files are by default saved in:
```bash
~/notes
```

the filename is the timestamp at which point the note was taken

the ~/notes directory is also version controlled with git

every time you add a new note the note is commited to the repo

other features are being built right now.

if you want one just raise an issue or pullrequest.

i will handle the rest
